- Kids note app (or another better naming)

  An web app to store children details and documentations, such as names, blood type, special foto and certificate.

  The one who manage it is their parents, one can be their father or mothers. They can also set up the plan for their kids about what do they want to achieve and their plan when reaching certain ages.

  On the home page, there are bunch of articles to support about parenting and life.

  Tech stack will be using React and firebase, planning to use react native for future mobile app development.
