# Ideas
A repository to store my ideas so I won't forget

- Kids note app (or another better naming)

  An web app to store children details and documentations, such as names, blood type, special foto and certificate.

  The one who manage it is their parents, one can be their father or mothers. They can also set up the plan for their kids about what do they want to achieve and their plan when reaching certain ages.

  On the home page, there are bunch of articles to support about parenting and life.

  Tech stack will be using React and firebase, planning to use react native for future mobile app development.

- Muslim Kids Web App

  A web app for kids to learn islam as fun as we can serve.

  The web may contain many interactive multimedia such as button for hijaiyah, surah, serve colorful images and so on.

  Would be using next js and firebase, but I think the website may be slower. So I may need a web page for seo and a web app for the fun part.

- Indonesian Chess website

  Blog page, App page (app and profile)
  Techstack will be using react, material ui.

- Formulir Web App

  As I see many huge company is using airtable - https://try.airtable.com/forms to create very useful and customizable form. Slip in my mind to create one for Indonesian people only. Hmm might be interesting.

- Link whatsapp generator

  Create a web app to generate whatsapp link along with the number and message, the link that is generated, when clicked or visited will lead to whatsapp including the messages.

- Al Qur'an Randomizer

  Uses PWA to create simple web app shows you a random ayah, the tech would be using next, bootstrap and hosted on vercel. It also has a design of mobile first and having a menu to search certain surah and ayah.

  The main display will shows ayah, surah details, and translation in Bahasa. API will be using http://alquran.cloud/ or this one https://github.com/sutanlab/quran-api
